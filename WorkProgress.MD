# Decide the GWAS summary statistics datasets to use

1. Compare 4 papers (Ferkingstad, Ahola-Olli, Lasse Folkersen, Sinnott-Armstrong) by the coverage of common cytokine/chemokine.

  * code: [Cytokine_chemokine_coverage.R](https://github.com/Volvic-19/Cytokine_Chemokine_Basis/blob/main/Code/Cytokine_chemokine_coverage.R)

  * Table of common cytokine/chemokines was generated from book [<Cytokines, Chemokines and Their Receptors>](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK6294/)
  * We map the availabe traits from 4 papaers with common cytokine/chemokine table based on Uniprot ID. Summary of coverage is in [Summary of coverage](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lXT4dmS9ogFrl2nv5Qr2KHEoDk5g2vf2kOv9OzG8El4/edit#gid=1947277513)
